In this repository you will be able to find a code that cleans up data for the NYC citibike website by converting the date into actual date format for tableau interpretation.
Also attached in the beginning of this Readme file you can find the tableau public link. Includes :
A dash board page with direct link to the diferrent workbook in botton format.
### Workbooks :
1) Checkout times for user - This worksheet includes a line graphh with the visualization for the time that each ride takes in the x axis and the amount of users in the Y axis.
2) Checkout times by gender - This worksheet includes the same as the previous one but each color line represents a gender.
3) Trips ber weekday per hour - This worksheet includes a heatmap with the hours of the day as rows and weekday as columns, the darker the color the most rides that occur in those hours and days.
4) Trips ber weekday per hour by gender - This worksheet includes same as the previous one but divided by gender.
5) Trips ber weekday per hour by usertype - This worksheet includes a heatmap by gender and weekday depending on the usertype.

### Conclusion
As a conclusion based on the data and visualization we could define than the gender with the higher amount or rides are males. While the most common hour to ride is w around 9 am and 6 pm which is the time people usually go to the office.
Finally Thursday is the most common day and subscribers are the usertype that use the bikes more therefore we could say they're taking advantage of the subscription.
